2002-01-13    <jake@riggshill.com>
    * several bug reports have com in in the last month:
    * absoulte jarfile paths were not handled correctly - was testing
    agains PATH separator instead of FILE separator - fixed
    * release: 0.3.3

2001-05-02    <jake@riggshill.com>
    * added <library> tag allowing insertion of entire jars
    or directories into the jar - new class LibrarySpec.java
    updated docs to reflect new tag
    * bug fix: JeffP reports that in using cascading project files
    only the first <genjar> invocation works correctly, the rest mysteriously
    'drop' class files
    Fixed - was using a static Set to track thos classes already resolved.  Making
    this set non-static fixed the problem

2001-04-25    <jkohler@JKOHLER>

    * src/org/apache/tools/ant/taskdefs/optional/genjar/GenJar.java:
    added project.baseDir to generated jar file name - bug reported
    by JeffPost - jars were ending up in the root dir
    * bumped to rev 0.2.4

2001-04-23    <jkohler@JKOHLER>
    * src/org/apache/tools/ant/taskdefs/optional/genjar/GenJar.java:
    added duplicate removal - all incoming jarEntries are tested against
    existing list - first addition wins
    * bumped to rev 0.2.3

2000-12-20    <jkohler@JKOHLER>

    * build.xml  revamped and added targets to
    run tests and build distributions

2000-12-19  John Kohler  <jake@raptor.riggshill.com>

    * docs/genjar.html: minor edits

    * build.xml: added usage target and rebuild target
    start of effort to make a real build file
    I don't think it's apprpriate for a Task build file to rely
    upon that task - so it should use the regular jar task to build
    its jar.
