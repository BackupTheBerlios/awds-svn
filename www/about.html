<h1>AWDS - Ad-hoc Wireless Distribution Service.</h1>
    <blockquote>very short: <i>AWDS  implements a layer 2 routing protocol for wireless mesh networks.</i></blockquote>

<p>
A wireless network consists of a set of computers that are
equipped with a wireless network interface. We assume that this
interface conforms with the Wireless LAN Standard (IEEE-802.11). For
covering larger area like office buildings, public areas, etc.,
normally the infrastructure mode of the Wireless LAN standard is
used. Here, many Access Points are connected to a wired backbone which
leads to the rest of the network. The last hop, from the Access Point
to the end user, is a wireless link.
</p><p>
However, in some cases the infrastructure mode cannot be applied. This
is normally the case, when no wired backbone is available and cannot
be deployed. Reasons can be that the network spans public areas
(like community networks) or the building does not allow to install a
wired network. One solution are mesh networks. 
</p><p>
In a wireless mesh network, all devices are interconnected by a
wireless link. There no wired backbone network. However, for a
connection to the Internet, at least on node must have a wired
connection. All nodes have the same role and act as forwarder for
packets. In theory, no Access Points are required, but some fixed
devices can exist that form the permanent part of the network. 
</p><p>
For building a wireless mesh network two approaches exist. The first
one is the use of a wireless mesh or MANET routing protocol. One of
the most popular is the <a href="">Optimized Link State Routing</a> - OLSR, e.g.
implemented in the software available at <a href="http://www.olsr.org">www.olsr.org</a>. It is
used in many community networks, like the German <a href="http://www.freifunk.net">Freifunk Project</a>.
 The networks have a very high number of nodes
(above 400) and run stable for several years. The protocol is implemented as a
routing daemon that operates on top of layer 3 (IP layer). Packets are
routed based on their IP destination address, similar to the Internet.
However, this also means that other protocols cannot be used, i.e. DHCP, IPX, or
IPv6.  The topology of the network is monitored and routes are
determined dynamically. Failed nodes are detected and not used for
routing. Changes in the connectivity are compensated. Therefore, it
can be considered as self-configuring and self-healing. 
</p><p>
Another approach is the Wireless Distribution Service (WDS). It allows
Access Points to act as repeater. The WDS is part of the IEEE-802.11
standard, but not supported by all manufactures. Furthermore, some
part of WDS are not specified in detail, which means that different
products are not always compatible with each other. The routing is done in Layer
2. The Ethernet like payload is routed while containing arbitrary protocols
like IP, IPv6, DHCP, etc. This solves problems like address
assignment and limitations to the use of IP. The routes are normally configured by manually entering
the neighbors MAC addresses in every Access Point. Thus, the routing
is static and features like self-configuration and self-healing are
not present. 
</p><p>
AWDS is a new approach which tries to combine the flexibility of layer
2 routing with the self-x capabilities of OLSR. It is implemented as a
Unix/Linux daemon and operates completely in user space. For
addressing, the unique MAC addresses of the wireless network card is used,
which means that no addresses must be configured. The routing is based
on Link State Routing, similar to OLSR. For communicating with 
applications, the AWDS daemon creates a virtual Ethernet
interface (awds0). All packets inserted here are received by the AWDS daemon
and can be forwarded to other stations. The destination AWDS instance
unpacks the Ethernet frames and deliverers them via  its awds0
device. Thus, from the users point of view all virtual Ethernet
devices are interconnected like a Ethernet-based LAN. Bridging can be
used for integrating this wireless network in an existing
infrastructure. On top of it, the typical protocols and software is
used, like DHCP for address assignment, NetBios for discovering
Windows/Samba shares, HTTP/TCP/IP for browsing the Internet, etc. 
</p><p>
In addition to the routing functionality, further features are present
that help to use and maintain the network and to develop extensions. 
</p><p>
AWDS uses the Ad-Hoc mode of the wireless cards, which only provides
WEP encryption. As WEP is known to be insecure, AWDS implements additional,
stronger encryption based on AES/CCM. 
</p><p>
A common problem in wireless mesh networks is the diagnosis of
connectivity problems. The [topology viewer] helps by showing a real-time
visualization of the wireless topology. It's based on Java/Swing and
XML for data exchange with the routing daemon. 
</p><p>
For further analysis of network problems an interactive shell is
used. The typical network debugging tools -- ping and traceroute --
are available. These operate in the AWDS layer, which means that they
can be used without prior assignment of IP addresses. The shell is
extensible and various modules add commands, e.g. for monitoring the
debug output. 
</p><p>
The development of wireless mesh protocols is another challenge that
must be solved. Testing of the software would require a test bed of
several nodes, which is expensive and difficult to maintain.
Therefore, many protocols are developed based on simulation. The
network simulators <a href="http://nsnam.sf.net">NS-2</a> or [Opnet] are mostly chosen for this task.
However, implementations developed this way can only be used in the
simulator and only few of them are ever implemented for real use. We
solved this problem by using libGEA. It provides an abstraction layer
between the routing and the underlying runtime environment. The
underlying runtime environment can  either be a Unix-like operation
system or the network simulator NS-2. This way, the same implementation is
used for simulation and real use. It allows developers to try new approaches or 
fix bugs without deploying the software in a large mesh network. The simulator can be used 
by all that are interested in development of such networks.
