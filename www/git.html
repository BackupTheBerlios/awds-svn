<h1>AWDS - git</h1>

<p>The AWDS developers have abandoned its <a href="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/awds/">Subversion repository</a> in
favor of <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a>. 
</p>
<p>Git is a distributed revision control system. Every developer has
its own copy of the software repository. This means, there is no
central server where you can download the current development
version. Instead, you can only get the current version of a specific
developer.</p>


<h2>Known git repositories</h2>
<p>
The following git repositories are known. You can download the copy of
a repository with <tt>git clone &lt;address&gt;</tt>. To
make it easier for to copy-n-paste, each line contains the command for
downloading the repository.
</p>

<p>
As <a>Andre Herms</a> is currently the main developer, his repository
is the main one. The code is stable most of the time and bugfixes go
directly in this tree. 
<pre class="cmdline">git clone http://aland.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/~aherms/awds-aherms.git</pre>
</p>


<p>
Georgs tree contains more experimental and upcoming features.
