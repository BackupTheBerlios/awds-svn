    <h1>AWDS - How does it work?</h1>
    
    <p>
  In this section we describe the principle of the AWDS routing. 
It provides a wireless mesh routing for ad hoc networks. First, some definitions.

    </p> 
    
    <h2>Ad Hoc Mode</h2>
    <p> 

The Wireless LAN (WLAN) standard IEEE-802.11 defines two modes of operation for a wireless client: 
ad-hoc and infrastructure mode. The infrastructure mode is the normally used one. Here, all clients are
connected to one Access Point (AP). The AP is connected to a backbone network. Normally, the services like
DNS, DHCP, and Internet gateway are provides by a server in this backbone network. An extension of this are
WLAN routers that include a DSL modem. In this mode the wireless link is used as the last hop from the 
Internet to the client. 
    </p>
    
<p> 
The ad hoc mode is intended for situations, where no communication infrastructure is in range. Imagine 
two persons sitting in a train that want to exchange some documents. They have no Access Point in range and 
therefore cannot connect their laptops. The Ad hoc mode allows them to link devices directly. IP addresses must by 
assigned manually (or by some magic auto-configuration). They also have to use these bare IP addresses because there is 
no name service. And, of course, there is no Internet access. However, at least they can communicate and 
share their documents. 
</p>
    
<h2>Mesh Routing</h2>

<p>
The ad hoc mode can be used when no infrastructure is available. However, under normal conditions, only devices
can communicate with each other when they are in direct communication range. The only way to overcome this limitation
is to make stations forward packets to a destination not in range. The decision, which packet are forwarded 
by which station is the task of the routing. In an arbitrary network with many wireless devices, multiple ways to 
a destination will exist. As this topology is meshed, it is called a mesh routing. Normally, the routing rules are
complex and cannot be created manually. A routing protocol is used instead, like the one provided by AWDS. 
</p>

<h2>Link State Routing </h2>

    <p> 
AWDS uses a so called Link State Routing. In short, it can be described the following way:<br />
Every station periodically transmits broadcast packets (HELLO packets) that are received by neighbours in 
communication range. The packets contain the source address and, thereby, after a while all stations know 
their neighbours, that can be used for routing. This list of neighbours is periodically flooded through the network. 
Flooding means, that it is broadcasted once and all stations that receive the packet, also broadcast the packet once. 
This way the packet is received by every station in the network. The information is the Link State which consists of
all links in the network. After a while every station knows about all links. It has the complete view of the 
topology. 
</p>

    <p>
The topology is the basis for the routing decisions. If a node has to forward a packet, it uses a shortest path
algorithm to find a suitable next hop that is closer to the destination. Routing metrics can be applied that
can weight the links. Furthermore, special mechanisms are included that avoid certain problems that are specific for 
wireless networks, like weak or unidirectional links. 
</p>

<p>
The Link State routing provides two primitives that are used in the following: A unicast routing that allows to 
send a packet to a specific station, and a network wide broadcast by via flooding. 
</p>

<h2>Virtual Ethernet Connector </h2>

    <p>
The link state routing allows the routing daemon on all devices in the network to communicate with each other. 
However, we want to use a web browser or FTP client. Therefore, the AWDS routing creates a virtual Ethernet device
with the <a href="http://vtun.sf.net">VTUN device driver</a> that is included in the Linux kernel. It looks like 
a typical Ethernet device. Packets written to it are received by the routing daemon and the daemon can 
write packets to it that are received by the kernel's network stack. 

</p>

<p>
The AWDS daemon tunnels packets from one virtual Ethernet device to another one with its routing primitives. 
Broadcast or multicast packets are flooded (identified by the broadcast bit in the destination MAC address). Packets
to a specific destination are send via unicast if the destination is known. Otherwise, they are also flooded. 
A MAC address is known when it is found in the MAC table of the routing. This works like the MAC table of
an ordinary Ethernet switch - when a packet is received from an AWDS instance, the source MAC of the contained packet 
is associated with the wireless device. The typical behaviour of the network stack, like broadcasting ARP request, 
helps that the MAC table is filled immediately. 

</p>

<p>
From the users point of view the routing looks like a switched Ethernet. The network device can be used 
for every protocol, that can also be used with a standard Ethernet. The virtual device can also be bridged with 
other Ethernet devices, and thereby become integrated in an existing infrastructure. DHCP can be used for address
assignment, multicast protocols like UPnP or multicast DNS can be used for service discovery. IPv6 and IPX work as
well.
