The AWDS developers do not use SVN anymore for the routing protocol.
We use GIT instead. We have deleted all files from the SVN repository 
to avoid confusion.

If required, you can grab the old sources by digging in the SVN history. 

For a list of git repositories, have a look in the corresponding file.
